ans:we are having mainly 3 micro services 1.user service 2.order service 3.product service each service is created as docker image the microservices deployed using docker compose


6 Can you write a sample docker compose file to setup a multi container architecture
ans:
---
version: "3.7"

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./www:/var/www/html

  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - ./db:/var/lib/mysql

  phpmyadmin:
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
    links:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
...

8 How do you create images in docker.
ans: we can create docker image with the help of docker commit command and also with the Dockerfile
----docker commit container-id image-name
----docker build -t image-name .

9 Do you have experience in setting up a docker private registry
create an dockerhub account.create one repo.for login into  you are accont we use a command docker login.we can push the docker image from local host to dockerhub.and we can pull the image from dockerhub.

10 How can we see the logs of a container

ans:docker logs container-id

11 What are the different types of volumes and explain where you have used them
ans:
1.simple docker volumes: it is used for data storing.but we can store one container data only.we cant re use it
2.sharable docker volumes:same volume shared between multiple containers.what ever changes done by one container that will be reflectrd in another container
3.docker volume containers:we can share the data between local host to container container to local host.it is bidirectional
12. what is cache busting?
ans:when ever we create an docker image with the dockerfile the data will be stored in docker cache.if  want to create new image with same docker file older data will not exicuted that will be takes from docker cache.new data will be exicuted.we want to exicute older data and new data without taking from cache we use --no-cache
docker build --no-cache -t container-name .

13.what is dangling volume?
ans: when ever u delete an container but the volume is still persistent in local machine then we called as dangling volume

14.version: "3.8"
   services: 
   	myjank:
		image: jenkins/jenkins
		ports:
		- "5050:8080"
	mydb:
		image: mysql:latest
		environment:
		  	MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: iq
		volumes:
		- /db:var/lib/mysql
